Q: Tell me about a time when you saw a peer struggling and decided to step in and help. What was the situation? Why did you decide to step in? What actions did you take?

he worked in starbucks ,he was a shift supervisor ,he wanted to be a manager, had a colleague that was struggling

What was the situation?
she was overwhelmed with the amount of drinks that was coming in, she was being anxious
Why did you decide to step in?
he stepped in because she was struggling

What actions did you take?
he knew she needed a break ,he moved her to a different teams

Another example was in grad school, they decided to build a website site ,he had a colleague who had issues using wordpress

he was able to help the colleague startup by sharing him articles and that helped the colleague and he is presently doing great at the project.

Q: Describe a time when you didn't think you were going to meet a commitment you promised.
 How did you identify the risk and communicate it to stakeholders?
In grad school,he created a ML site ,the original design was to use mongodb, ,the features he wanted to develop ,it was not possible using mongodb
for the two months inview  ,that was not possible
,he was behind and not sure of completing the project, he changed to using SQL to enable him meet the project deadline.

 Is there anything you would do differently?
he should have known more about mongodb  and can manage that better
he underestimated the technology
in the future,write down the technology, see if it is something that is possible


***Earn Trust***
Q: Give me an example of an idea you had that was strongly opposed. Why was there so much resistance? How did you handle the negative feedback?
the first thing that comes to mind ,the store had a slow speed of service ,from observing the first couple of weeks ,he saw the store was not implementing
starbucks core tenets ,he asked why people were not doing things efficiently, he presented the idea but that was rejected

Why was there so much resistance?
people were just resisting it because it was a change to the norm they knew previously

 How did you handle the negative feedback?
 He told them to give it a chance and if it does not work ,then reevaluate and try again.

Q: Give me an example of a significant professional/educational failure. What led you to making the wrong decision? What did you learn from this situation?
*Sit*: he was trying to become an engineer, two years into the program ,he did not like the program because it was not his passion ,it look a long time to convince
himself to leave the program, he feels like he failed
*Task*: that was the reason he went to starbucks and completed his degree and his masters
What did you learn from the situation
trust his judgement ,if it was not for him ,then he had to make the right decision and get out.


***Dive Deep***
Q: Tell me about a time you were trying to understand a problem on your team and you had to go down several layers to figure it out.
they had a team project like an advanced database class, they were in a team of 3, one of the teammates understood the problem and that meant that others
were not involved and they had to speak to her to allow others get the project going as well, they had to define their individual roles to make this possible
they created expectations and they worked together to turn in a great project

What approach did you take. Who did you talk with and what information proved most valuable?
speak to your team members and the team agreed to share roles as she was doing just about everything
How did you use that information to help solve the problem?
 once you shred roles that enabled all to be involve

Q: Give me a situation in which it took you asking why five times to get to the root cause.
*Sit*: at starbucks ,there was money missing, there is possible to be two audits, the audits were not being done, his manager was overwhelmed and the audits
were not being done, he said that he could help out
